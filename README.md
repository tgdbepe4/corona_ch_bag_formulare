# CODVI19 registration forms for PC processing

Many doctors mentioned on Twitter that they have to manually process the registration of new CODVI19 cases with the Federal Office for Health, BAG on a printed PDF form. This takes time and sending by email is complicated because the completed sheet needs to be scanned before sending. And FAX is really very old-fashioned!

Some noted that they would suggest and help establish an electronic solution. But that also takes time and needs training in how to use it.

This gave me the idea of ​​expanding the PDF files with form fields. This new files can then now be filled in on the PC und sending via e-mail.
